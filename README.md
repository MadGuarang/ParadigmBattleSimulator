Paradigm Battle Simulator
Overview
Paradigm Battle Simulator, developed by MadGuarang, is a browser-based application designed to simulate tactical battles between customizable armies. This project focuses on providing a platform where users can set up their armies, configure unit types, weapons, and engage in simulated battles to determine the outcome based on strategic choices and unit statistics.

Features
Army Configuration: Players can configure their armies by selecting unit types, setting unit counts, and choosing melee and ranged weapons for each unit.
Dynamic Updates: The simulator dynamically updates unit capabilities based on selected configurations, allowing for strategic adjustments before battles.
Battle Simulation: Engage in simulated battles where armies clash based on predefined unit statistics and strategic decisions made during setup.
Outcome Display: After simulation, the battle outcome is displayed, showing scores and declaring the victor based on surviving troop counts.
Usage
Setup: Open index.html in a web browser.
Player Setup: Configure your army by selecting unit types and weapons for each unit.
Enemy Setup: Configure the opposing army with similar options.
Start Battle: Initiate the battle simulation to see the outcome based on your strategic choices.
Reset: Reset the battle setup to start a new simulation.
Technology
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end development for user interface and interactivity.
Browser Compatibility: Compatible with modern web browsers for seamless usage.
Customization and Tweaking
This simulator is built as a framework, allowing enthusiasts to customize and experiment. The unit.js file contains data for units and weapons. We encourage users to tweak this data to see how it affects battle outcomes and unit performance.

Future Enhancements
Add more unit types and weapons for greater customization.
Implement advanced battle algorithms and visualizations.
Include multiplayer capabilities for competitive simulations.
